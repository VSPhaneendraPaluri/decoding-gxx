Being an electronics engineer myself, coding doesn't come naturally to me.  But, this fasication on how software understands the hardware always drove me crazy.  So, this site is dedicated towards my attempts at undersanding the software, mainly the gxx (gcc and g++) compilers, specifically.

GXX, having been availble since 1980's, has been one of the vey old and vast pool of open-source sources and tools.  There is always this GNU documentation page that helps the readers explain the internals of GCC and also, there have been many impressive posts too posted by many authors.  There is never a shortage of information but there have been few getting started tutorials related to GCC.  This blog shall be dedicated to hosting such information that is interesting and at the sametime, somehow I'll try write it to make it worth-while read.

Welcome to the world of learning GCC ! :)
