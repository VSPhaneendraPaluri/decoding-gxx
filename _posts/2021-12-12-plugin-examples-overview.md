There has been some delay in last few months on updates to this page.<br>
But, this post should redirect the users to the current status of the examples.

# Few Changes to this Project Site
Since, I presume the examples to be self-explanatory, hence, I've decided to atleast stop writing individual posts for each GXX plugin example.

# What to Expect in this Post ?
I'd rather try to put together a synopsys of my learnings while writing few Gxx plugins here as part of this post.

# Plugin Examples
The ```Plugin Name``` of individual plugin examples have been hyperlinked with their reelvant source code.

| S.No. | Plugin Name | Remarks |
| ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| 1. | [00_dummy_plugin](https://github.com/VSPhaneendraPaluri/decoding-gxx/blob/master/plugins/00_dummy_plugin/DummyGxxPlugin.cpp) | Demonstrates on how to get started with GCC Plugins<br>Setting up the basic infra-structure, and so on |
| 2. | [01_basic_plugin](https://github.com/VSPhaneendraPaluri/decoding-gxx/blob/master/plugins/01_basic_plugin/BasicGxxPlugin.cpp) | A basic plugin on how to express plugin name, version and so on |
| 3. | [02_custom_metadata_plugin](https://github.com/VSPhaneendraPaluri/decoding-gxx/blob/master/plugins/02_custom_metadata_plugin/CustomMetaDataPlugin.cpp) | Illustrates how to append GCC plugin info'with user provided data |
| 4. | [03_plugin_info_by_cb](https://github.com/VSPhaneendraPaluri/decoding-gxx/blob/master/plugins/03_plugin_info_by_cb/PluginInfobyCallback.cpp) | Sample template demonstrates the various hooks provided by the GCC in order to understand the various phases/states during a plugin execution |
| 5. | [04_cxx_ast](https://github.com/VSPhaneendraPaluri/decoding-gxx/blob/master/plugins/04_cxx_ast/CxxAst.cpp) | Showcases how to parse the C++ AST tree generated by the GCC Front-End |

# Few Mentions
- As and where possible, I've tried to provide necessary comments within the sources itself.
- I'll try to consolidate all my learnings so far until now regarding GXX in another post.

Until then, keep exploring !! :smile:
